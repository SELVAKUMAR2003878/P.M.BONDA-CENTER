            <p id="myp">Coconut water is the clear liquid inside young coconuts. In early development, it serves as a suspension for the endosperm of the coconut during the nuclear phase of development.
                As development continues, the endosperm matures into its cellular phase and deposits into the rind of the coconut pulp. The liquid inside young coconuts is sometimes preferred to the liquid of a ripened coconut.
                Coconut water from young green coconuts is also known specifically as buko juice in Philippine English.
                It increases urinary potassium, chloride, and citrate, which can help prevent stone formation.Potassium-rich foods and drinks like coconut water may lower the risk of kidney stones.</p>

                        Potassium also affects overall vascular health, reducing the chances of stroke.
                        The potassium in coconut water helps the kidneys excrete high sodium levels from the body.
                        It contains an impressive amount of potassium, which has been shown to lower blood pressure.
                        Coconut water contains a type of saturated fat known as lauric acid, which helps to raise levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and improve heart health.
                        It is a good source of electrolytes, essential for maintaining proper fluid balance and preventing dehydration, which can contribute to high blood pressure.
                        In addition, lauric acid helps lower blood pressure by reducing inflammation and improving blood vessel function.
